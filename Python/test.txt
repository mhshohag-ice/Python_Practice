Cloud computing is not a location, but rather a pool of resources that can be rapidly provisioned in an
automated, on-demand manner. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cloud
computing in Special Publication (SP) 800-145 as “a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand
network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (such as networks, servers, storage,
applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or
service provider interaction.”
The value of cloud computing is the ability to pool resources together to achieve economies of scale and
agility. This is true for private or public clouds. Instead of having many independent and often under-used
servers deployed for your enterprise applications, pools of resources are aggregated, consolidated, and
designed to be elastic enough to scale with the needs of your organization.
The move toward cloud computing not only brings cost and operational benefits but also technology benefits.
Data and applications are easily accessed by users no matter where they reside, projects can scale easily, and
consumption can be tracked effectively. Virtualization is a critical part of a cloud computing architecture that,
when combined with software orchestration and management tools, allows you to integrate disparate
processes so that they can be automated, easily replicated, and offered on an as-needed basis.
